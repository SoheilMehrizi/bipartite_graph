🧠 Bipartite Graph Generator & Detector
This Jupyter Notebook contains two modules to work with bipartite graphs:

Bipartite Graph Generator
Randomly generates bipartite graphs using a two-partite structure.

Bipartite Graph Detector (Coloring Method)
Detects whether a given graph is bipartite using the BFS-based two-coloring algorithm.


🚀 How to Run
Open the notebook in Jupyter or JupyterLab.

Run the cells in order:

First cell: Generates a bipartite graph

Second cell: Tests the generated or custom graph for bipartiteness using coloring

📌 Notes
The generator ensures the graph is bipartite by construction.

The detector works for any undirected graph, not just bipartite ones.

You can visualize the graph structure using NetworkX and Matplotlib.
